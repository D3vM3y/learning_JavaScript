// tasks to train your knowledge on variables
// Working with variables
// 1. Declare two variables: admin and firstName.
let admin;
let firstName;
// 2. Assign the value "John" to firstName.
firstName = "John";
// 3. Copy the value from firstName to admin.
admin = firstName;
// 4. Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).
alert("Admin: " + admin);

// Giving the right name
// 1. Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
let planetEarth;

let currentUser;
